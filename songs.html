                Bought it at the five and dime
                Played it 'til my fingers bled
                Was the summer of '69
                Me and some guys from school
                Had a band and we tried real hard
                Jimmy quit and Jody got married
                I should've known we'd never get far
                Oh, when I look back now
                That summer seemed to last forever
                And if I had the choice
                Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
                Those were the best days of my life
                Ain't no use in complainin'
                When you got a job to do
                I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
                And that's when I met you, yeah!
                Standin' on your mama's porch
                You told me that you'd wait forever
                Oh, and when you held my hand
                I knew that it was now or never
                Those were the best days of my life
                Oh, yeah
                Back in the summer of '69, oh
                Man, we were killin' time
                We were young and restless
                We needed to unwind
                I guess nothing can last forever
                Forever, no
                Yeah
                And now the times are changin'
                Look at everything that's come and gone
                Sometimes when I play that old six-string
                I think about you, wonder what went wrong
                Standin' on your mama's porch
                You told me that it'd last forever
                Oh, and when you held my hand
                I knew that it was now or never
                Those were the best days of my life
                Oh, yeah
                Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh
                It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah
                Me and my baby in '69, oh, oh
                It was the summer, summer, summer of '69
